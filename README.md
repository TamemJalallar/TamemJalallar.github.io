## About Me

Senior IT Systems Administrator and Technical Lead with 6+ years of enterprise experience supporting executive leadership, automating workflows, and managing large-scale identity, endpoint, and infrastructure environments.

I specialize in modern endpoint management, identity & access control, and automation across Windows and macOS ecosystems. My work focuses on security, reliability, compliance, and user experience, and I’m frequently relied upon as a primary escalation point, mentor, and problem-solver for complex technical challenges.

I enjoy turning fragmented processes into scalable, repeatable systems that reduce operational friction and improve outcomes for both users and IT teams.
